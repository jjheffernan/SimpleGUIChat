This chat client/server is intended to have a IRC type flavor, although 
implemented differently.

There are several modes that can be set on a user:
o = Owner, all privileges
a = Admin, most privileges (except for changing Admin flags)
m = Moderator, most Admin privileges except for changing Admin and Banned flags
t = Trusted, just a mark of respect
q = Quiet, can only speak in asides
s = Silent, cannot talk at all
b = Banned.

This project is a merged fork of NeuralNine's chat tutorial, and "The learners of the Python Forum"
Chat on github (https://github.com/The-Learners-of-the-Python-Forum/chat-program/tree/sample-implementation)
